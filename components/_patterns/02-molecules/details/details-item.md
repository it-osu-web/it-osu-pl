title: Details
---

The `<details>` tag can be used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close.

This component takes four variables: `variant`, `details_icon`, `details_summary`, `details_content`.

`variant: plus` will replace the native arrow with plus/minus controls.

The `details_icon` variable is only valid with the `plus` variant, and takes a Font Awesome 5 icon. For example: `fas fa-exclamation-triangle`
