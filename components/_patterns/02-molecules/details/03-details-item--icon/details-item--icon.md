title: Details
---

The `<details>` tag can be used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close. Any sort of content can be put inside the `<details>` tag.

This variation includes a FontAwesome icon (example: `fas fa-exclamation-triangle`) and uses plus/minus controls instead of the native arrow.
